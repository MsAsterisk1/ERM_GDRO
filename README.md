# ERM_GDRO
Fine Control of the Trade-off Between ERM and gDRO

Project Description:

The trade-off in accuracy between ERM and gDRO is well known, with ERM tending to perform better overall while gDRO improves on worst-group performance. Though the trade-off is commonly known, there exist few tools to give intuitive, direct, and fine-grained control over it. This project presents a simple linear combination of ERM and gDRO that provides such a tool.
