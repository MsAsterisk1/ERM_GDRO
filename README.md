# ERM_GDRO
An Analysis of Generated Feature Representations under Different Loss Regimes

Elias Furst & Thomas Zeng

##Project Description

This project attempts to analyze the features generated when models are trained using different loss functions. This is done with the hopes of discovering a method to create more robust, i.e. seperable, features and thus more robust models.
